# ai-application-tracker
This project started as a Hackathon Project at HackMIT, where we placed in the challenge for building an application that automates email. 
Automatically parse your emails for the application status of jobs &amp; internships.
Your application processes will be automatically updated and viewable from a webpage.
Development is still in progress to begin hosting and allow for onboarding users.
